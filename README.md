# Altera MAX V Fuse Map (by experiment)

This is a puzzle.
Can I work out the fuse map of MAX V devices by
feeding the Quartus tools
and observing the outputs?

My experiments are being run in the following
[environment](doc/environment.md).

## Assumptions

 * [Fuse ordering](doc/fuse-ordering.md)
 * [Fuse vs bit](doc/fuse-vs-bit.md)
 * [Default settings](doc/default-settings.md)

## Experiments

 * [User code](experiments/src/user_code_experiment.erl)
 * [Fuse count](experiments/src/fuse_count_experiment.erl)
 * [Generate pins](experiments/src/generate_pins.erl)
 * [Unused pins](experiments/src/unused_experiment.erl)

## Fuses

### `{user_code, bit()}`

There are 32 bits of user oode numbered LSB (0) to MSB (31).

The user code bits are stored in the POF file inverted,
so a user code bit of `1` is stored as a `0`.

### `{ioc(), bus_hold}` and `{ioc(), weak_pull_up}`

Each IOC can have bus-hold or weak pull-up enabled.

The feature is enabled when the POF bit is `0`.

Warning: only enable __one__ at a time.

### `{ioc(), input}`

The IOC is an input when the POF but is `0`.
