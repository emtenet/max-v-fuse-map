# Altera MAX V Fuse Map (by experiment)

This is a puzzle.
Can I work out the fuse map of MAX V devices by
feeding the Quartus tools
and observing the outputs?

My experiments are being run in the following
[environment](doc/environment.md).

## Assumptions

 * [Fuse ordering](doc/fuse-ordering.md)
 * [Fuse vs bit](doc/fuse-vs-bit.md)
 * [Default settings](doc/default-settings.md)

## Experiments

 * [User code](experiments/src/user_code_experiment.erl)
 * [Fuse count](experiments/src/fuse_count_experiment.erl)
 * [Generate pins](experiments/src/generate_pins.erl)
